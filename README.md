# GP GRADUATION PROJECT
Movie Moment is an iOS app developed with a sole purpose of entertaining the user. Using the artificial intelligence algorithms the app eases the all-time 'Which movie should I watch' dilemma and enriches the user's viewing experience along the way.

The main idea behind the project was creating an app that would use cognitive services to entertain the user while presenting some innovative ideas. Looking through the IMDB lists, querying Google to find a suitable movie can take hours – so, the idea was to create a fun way of significantly reducing the time lost on this search and at the same time finding a movie which would suit user's current mood. The user is expected to create a profile and take a selfie, after which the application detects the emotions on user’s face and using this analysis recommends movies suited for user’s current mood. The app remembers the date, time, mood and movie recommendations so the user has access to his mood timeline and is able to track the movies previously recommended for him. The user is able to mark movies as ‘watched’- excluding these movies from future recommendations. 
In order to obtain the movie information The Open Movie Database API is called.
